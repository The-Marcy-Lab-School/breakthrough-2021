## Flow

- Starting a web project from scratch
  - npm registry (https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - npm init
  - adding express
  - adding a route
  - adding nodemon (https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon)
  - adding route parameters
  - Install Postgres!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - handling different types of responses
- Making a project more flexible
  - static files (files that aren't dynamic)
  - Middleware (code that runs in between response/request), (app.use)
  - templates (handlebars, ejs, jade, etc)
  - templating engine (https://ejs.co/)
  - handling querystrings (req.query)
  - handling form data (POST), (requires middleware), (express.json, express.urlencoded)
  - REST
  - express generator
