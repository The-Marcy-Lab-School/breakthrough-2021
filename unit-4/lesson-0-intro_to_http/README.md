# Lesson 0: Intro to HTTP

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Flow

- [Protocols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol)(tcp, http, ftp, smtp, etc)
- [The HTTP Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
- Request/Response Cycle & Servers
  - Do we need to use the browser to make http requests?
  - Demo curl usage (use GH as example)
- Discuss DNS (IPV4/IPV6)
- Types of responses that we can get back once we locate the server (html, json, xml, etc)
- Stateless vs Stateful (session, jwt)
- Security
- difference between http & https
- (cors)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS]
- preventing session from getting hijacked
- httpOnly cookies,
- 2FA, requiring password for certain actions (Think Github when you want to delete a repo)
- Things you should be aware of
  - xsrf, ddos, cross site scripting

## Key Terms

- HTTP
- DNS
- TCP/IP
- Session
- Cookies
- Request/Response Cycle
- Same Origin Policy
- CORS
- HTTPS

## Essential Questions

- How do protocols ensure safe and secure transfer of data across the internet?
- What is the request/response cycle? How would you describe this to a non-technical person? What about a technical person?
- What is the difference between "stateless" and "stateful? How does that apply to the internet?
