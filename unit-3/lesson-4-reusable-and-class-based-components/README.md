# Lesson: Class Based Components

## Lesson Overview

### Key Terms

- class based components
- constructor function
- component lifecycle methods
- componentDidMount()
- shouldComponentUpdate()
- setState()

### Essential Questions

- How do class components differ from functional components?
- What are the benefits and tradeoffs of using hooks within functional components rather than class components?

### Learning Assigments

1. Internalize how and why React moved from functional components (pre-hooks) to class components by reading about [State and Lifecycle Methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

2. Refer to the documentation for [React Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), [constructor functions](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#constructor), [componentDidMount() lifecycle method](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount), [componentWillUpdate()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#unsafe_componentwillupdate), and [setState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

### Practice Overview

You will analyze the component structure of a legacy, class-based component during this lesson. Then you will convert that class-based component into a functional component that uses hooks.

### Steps:

1. Answer the [short answer questions](practice/short-response.md) about class based components before moving on to step 4.

2. Imagine you are working for an E-Commerce application that sells products with different categories. The data for your products looks like this:

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Hammer",
    priceInCents: 1000,
    categories: ["tools", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Coffee mug",
    priceInCents: 495,
    categories: ["dining", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Small Wooden Table",
    priceInCents: 47000,
    categories: ["dining", "home"],
  },
  // ...
];
```

What re-usable components might you create that could be used in the different category pages?

3. Implement the component system you designed above using functinoal components.
