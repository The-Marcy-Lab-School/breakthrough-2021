# Pokemon Application

In this application, you'll build an app to display a list of Pokemon. Use the `fetchPokemon` function to interact with the Pokemon API.

Install the packages using `npm install` or `yarn`, and run the test suite using `npm test` or `yarn test`. Build in order to get the tests passing. 

The test uses a mocked version of the `fetchPokemon` function. You can imagine a function that actually pulls data from another service or API (you'll learn how to do this for real in the future!) Basically, instead of actually calling the actual data source here, we fake an call so we don't have to actually interact with that service. We'll learn more about mocking in a future lesson.
