# Lesson 2: Events

## Flow

- Review
  - DOM Api, querying the DOM
  - HTML page, script tags (demo what it looks like from scratch)
  - does it matter where you put script tags? (https://javascript.info/script-async-defer)
  - different html elements
- Events (the star of today's show)
  - take a look at mdn docs
  - demonstrate adding an event
  - demonstrate removing an event
  - DOMContentLoaded event, and placement of script (also show how to use debugger keyword)
  - click events, keypresses, mouse clicks, (look into if we can use finger drag events)
  - debouncing on inputs and why that's important (cleatTimeout, setTimeOut)
  - demonstrate how different elements have different events
  - event propogation
  - default actions (links, forms, etc)
